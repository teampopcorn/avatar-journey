## About Me
  Code bender-in-training. I relate to water bending because I value adaptability and open-mindedness. I have a Bachelor's in Biochemistry and Biophysics, and I love learning about the nuances and subtleties in all aspects of life cause it makes the world a more interesting place for me. I enjoy programming because it has the nuances and logic that I like, and I am able to have more control over it (compared to biochemistry). As for my hobbies, I really enjoy playing piano, non-running physical activities, and anime!
