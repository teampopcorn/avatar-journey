About Nairobi:  First and foremost I love cooking for anybody. Even if you were my enemy I would still enjoy cooking for you. I love the outdoors, physical activity, hiking, camping, sports as well as indoors … sewing, knitting, drawing, coding and writing. There's so much to say I have yet to find anything I don’t like. I was born and raised in Kenya. I lived there for seven years until my day moved me to London where I lived for three years. I have moved around many countries within Africa. I’ve lived in Madagascar, Somalia, Ethiopia and Egypt. I speak eight languages fluently, which I do not mind speaking for you all if you want to hear. Right now I reside in Portland, Oregon and have been here for 16 years. I lost count after eight. I have done many things over the years, like going to the american school system like middle school, eight different high schools (probably more) and getting into a nine month culinary program. I received an Associates Degree in Psychology in Mount Hood. I actually hate psychology and went to undergrad in Biology and Nursing. There I went to Med School for three years, dropped out in my third year, which was a few years ago. From there I stopped pursuing things for the money and started doing things that I see myself doing forever, and that's why I am here at the beautiful Alchemy Code Lab.
