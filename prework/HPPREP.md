## About Heather
Jumping into the air from very high places has always been a thing for Heather ... literally and metaphorically. Truly committing to something that is scary (such as jumping from a plane or leaping headfirst into learning a new skill) requires repeated and deliberate surrender *and* is an essential quality necessary in bending air). This requires participation in a dance ... a dance between control and surrendering, which Heather finds exhilarating and incredibly meaningful. More than any other element, air is aware that beyond itself lies the unknown. *Believe that when you leap the appropriate net will appear.*

*"The true mind can weather all lies and illusions without being lost. The true heart can tough the poison of hatred without being harmed. From beginningless time, darkness thrives in the void, but always yields to purifying light. To bend another's will your own spirit must be unbendable, or you will be corrupted and destroyed." ~Ancient Lion Turtle*

### Air Nomad Introduction

I am *--word for mentor--* Heather. I am a member of the Order of the White Lotus and its most senior warrior. I will be your airbending mentor guiding you through a series of quests that will determine your level of mastery with airbending. Air is the element of freedom and the key to unlocking its potential is flexibility. To master airbending one must be adept at being aware of flow. Finding and following the path of least resistance is critical. Air Nomads are first and foremost pacifists and almost purely defensive. We only use our abilities to harm as an absolute last resort. Perceiving, reasoning and flexibility are core skills you will need to complete your training.

Air Nomad Attributes
* Pacifism
* Seek the path of least resistance when conflict arises
* Constant releasing of egoic attachment, resisting conformity, locating flow.

## Air Quests

### Bending Air

It is your second week of training and you have been working on conjuring a controlled flow of air around your body. The next step is to push that air in the direction you choose. You, pretty easily, were able to conjure a stream of air to flow around your body so you go into this next challenge confident. Heather has set up an obstacle course of various items of different weights, sizes and locations. You begin with the easiest ... a row of large rocks resting atop of a brick wall. Your task is simply to direct the stream of air flowing around you precisely enough to push one rock off of the wall without disturbing the other rocks. This task requires you to control the element as you direct the flow away from your body. You need to control the size, force and direction of the flow of air precisely.

* You are raring to go and excited for this new level of your training. You take a deep breath, conjure a steady flow of air around your body and PUSH! Your power is palpable and you do knock down only one rock and take the section of wall directly beneath it too. You are exhilarated. 

* You are ready. You feel confident. You quickly conjure a flow and push with both hands. You knock down the entire wall and all of its rocks. You jump up and down, silly with the feeling of power you have as Heather stands looking at you ... arms folded, head cocked, one eyebrow raised.

* You take your time. You sink into a meditative place, conjure a very controlled flow of air around your body. At just the right moment you flick a finger and a small burst of air zings across to delicately knock one rock off the wall. Somewhat anticlimatic, but just the right use of force and amount. Not too much, not too little.

### Stop Rising Rebellion Army

There is a rebellion army living in the Black Hills in Drachma near the Earth Kingdom. The have slowly been terrorizing, stealing from and over-taking the bordering towns and villages and are slowly creeping into the Earth Kingdom's territory. Something needs to be done to stop them and the Earth Kingdom reaches out to the Air Nomads for help. Pacifism is an airbender's first choice, but acts of force are sometimes necessary. Heather discusses with you how you would handle the situation. You suggest ...

CHOICES:

* capturing the leader and concentrating a wind storm over the rebellion until the camp is destroyed and the members are forced to move. 

* for you and your mentor to join with the Earth Kingdom to approach the rebellion camp and negotiate with them.

* that you go on a reconnaissance mission to gather information and then you and your mentor formulate a plan with the Earth Kingdom to strategically dismantle the rebellion using both of your elemental powers.    

### Confrontation with a Hurricane -- Ego?

You have mastered the harnessing of air to control the direction, quantity and force of an air stream. The next stage of training is to interact with the element on its terms. Heather takes you to a small village in the Earth Kingdom on the Eastern Sea where there are frequent tornados and occasionally a hurricane. This is so you can interact with the element defensively when it arises. You have only been there a few days and have been able to interact with a few small air funnels that have arisen out over the water, but there is a burgeoning hurricane heading toward the coast. Heather is called to meet with a counsel of elder benders from all four elemental nations to deal with the approaching storm. The storm directly effects the Earth Kingdom's eastern shores. Heather brings you with her. There is some disagreement as to how to handle the storm, but because the hurricane directly affects the Earth Kingdom it is ultimately their decision. There are three options being debated. Heather asks you to weigh in.

CHOICES:

* Redirect the water from the storm: There is a small town, the Misty Palm Oasis, located at the edge of the Si Wong Dessert. A giant mass of ice at the center of the city was formerly how the city was able to exist,but it is all but gone. The residents have lived there for hundreds of years, but will soon have to relocate as there will be no water. The Fire Nation has offered the suggestion for the Air Nation and the Water Tribe to work together to harness the water from the storm and direct it using the momentum of the wind toward the small town. Nothing like this has ever been attempted. It is only a *possibility* due to the force of the hurricane. It will take all of the skilled benders from both the Air Nation and Water Tribe to accomplish the task. The water and wind need to be directed in a stream toward the city and then essentially stopped over it, frozen in place and set down very precisely in the spot of the former mass of ice. This would allow the residents of the Misty Palm Oasis to remain, but it is a risky choice for all the towns living on the path the redirection would take from the Eastern Sea. You would get to participate and use the new skills you have learned.

* Adapt Environment: Hurricanes thrive in warm water. Send several water benders to cool the water around the hurricane, which should initially slow it and then quickly die down. This seems the simple and obvious solution, but means you do not get to use any of your new skills.

* Defend the Coast: Work with the other airbenders to redirect the path of the hurricane toward the South Pole in the hopes that when it hits cooler water the storm will dissipate. This would allow you to use your newly acquired skills and is likely to work, but is not full-proof.
