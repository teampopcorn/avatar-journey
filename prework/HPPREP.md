## About Heather
Jumping into the air from very high places has always been a thing for Heather ... literally and metaphorically. Truly committing to something that is scary (such as jumping from a plane or leaping headfirst into learning a new skill) requires repeated and deliberate surrender *and* is an essential quality necessary in bending air). This requires participation in a dance ... a dance between control and surrendering utterly, which Heather finds exhilarating and incredibly meaningful. More than any other element, air is aware that beyond itself lies the unknown. *Believe that when you leap the appropriate net will appear.*

*"The true mind can weather all lies and illusions without being lost. The true heart can tough the poison of hatred without being harmed. From beginningless time, darkness thrives in the void, but always yields to purifying light. To bend another's will your own spirit must be unbendable, or you will be corrupted and destroyed." ~Ancient Lion Turtle*

### Air Nomad Introduction

I am *--word for mentor--* Heather. I am a member of the Order of the White Lotus and its most senior warrior. I will be your air bending mentor guiding you through a series of quests that will determine your level of mastery with airbending. Air is the element of freedom and the key to unlocking its potential is flexibility. To master airbending one must be adept at being aware of flow. Finding and following the path of least resistance is critical. Air Nomads are first and foremost pacifists and almost purely defensive. We only use our abilities to harm as an absolute last resort. Perceiving, reasoning and flexibility are core skills you will need to complete your training.
